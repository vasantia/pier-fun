#Pier Fun Imports

We are going to work through how to recreate an e-commerce site with our own HTML/CSS skills. You may have noticed that most sites in this industry follow a pattern to their website.  Two of the most common pages are the list page where they will list out all matching items then the details page where a specific item is described in detail.  You are going to create a version of both.

## Detail Page
Use this page and create the layout with CSS and HTML.
* [Arm Chair](http://www.pier1.com/bayan-deluxe-armchair/3013083.html?cgid=outdoor-chairs#nav=left&start=1)
* Save your version in a `detail.html` file
* Do not worry about the drop down menus 
* Do not worry about the image zoom feature
* Assume all of the "Read More" buttons have been pressed and the text is at full length.
* You may use filler text if you wish or the same text from the page
* Don't worry about the footer of the page
* You can reuse the header of the page on the next section.

## List Page
Use the following page and create the layout with CSS and HTML.
* [Patio Furniture](http://www.pier1.com/outdoor-chairs#nav=left)
* Save your version in a `list.html` file
* Use the header from the previous section
* Only fill out 3 rows of products
* Do not worry about the drop downs
* Only fill out the left category through the "Chairs" category
